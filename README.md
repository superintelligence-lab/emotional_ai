# Is it possible to give emotions to Artificial Intelligence?

Bachelor thesis by Anna Braun · FOM University of Applied Sciences · Dec 15, 2021

The goal of my Bachelor's thesis was to find out whether AI systems could feel emotions themselves. I chose to test this idea by implementing fear into an AI system. To do this, I combined all neuroscientific insights on fear processes in the human brain into a computational model. I then coded this fear circuit in Python and implemented it into a state-of-the-art AI language model. My complete Bachelor's thesis can be found in the pdf file.
